Just... what just happened?? The Raid 2 is like getting punched in the head and then given a backrub, all while trapped in a tornado of fists and emotions. Still pulling pieces of popcorn outta my hoodie. The opening scene, damn! It kicks like a mule on Red Bull – guess I’ll need a chiropractor tomorrow. My back is rebelling, thanks theater seats, perfect timing.

That prison yard scene, it's a symphony of chaos. Mud flying like it's got a vendetta, sounds of smacking violence mixing with someone further up the aisle who decided unwrapping candy mid-gang fight was great idea. Are my hands shaking from cold or adrenaline?? Perhaps both?? It's like when you're trying to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and Wi-Fi just teases you with 99% completion. Pure anticipation, makes u wanna scream into the void. Also, someone’s phone buzzed during a quiet bit, how did they survive indignant glares?

> Iko Uwais is a pure storm, a typhoon in a trench coat. Does he even know how NOT to kick ass? Doubt it. Each move was an elegant murder dance, a ballet made of broken bones. Feels like my own bones got 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ed just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨. Scene transitions were like when you’re half-awake, half-dreaming, not knowing what’s real. Sliding from rain-soaked streets into bloody brawls like I slide into existential dread when I remember I didn’t actually save my work.

Oh, the orange lighting of that one tunnel shot, how it singed through the eyes. Aesthetics of a dream you can't quite remember but leaves you feeling all fuzzy. Wanted to yell something profound, ended up mumbling ‘this is ace’ while my brain zipped to the kitchen chase scene. Looks like something out of a twisted cooking show, where the main ingredient is danger and garnish is... survival?? Do I smell popcorn or just the panic sweat from my own palms?

𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? You asked? MAYBE. Sentence yourself to a 2-hour heart-attack wrapped in cinema glory. Just like finding a hidden and hauntingly beautiful file on an old computer, that you forgot you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed years ago. Except it punches you. Hard.

if (adrenaline > sanity) { chaos = true; dreams = Raid2(); } else { action = null; } // whoops, how'd that get here?
